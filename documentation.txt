================
## First Step ##
================
1. We start with creating main.go
and within it we put a simple command for printing Hello World on the screen.
We can see an error and this is not going to work, because we need to init our project module .

2. For that to happen we execute the following command:
```
go mod init booking-app 
```
which initiates our project and creates a go.mod file which is the module for our project

3. In go everything is organized in packages, so we need to start from that here:
As a first line in our GO application, we define the keyword "package" and then the name of the package,  
which our application will be part of - and the standard name for the main application is main.

4. The next thing expected is declaration, which basically means that GO doesn't know where to start executing the application, it needs an entrypoint.
We have to declare the entrypoint of our application - in which kine the execution of the code starts.
We create a function called main and put the logic within that main function.
```
func main() {
    application logic...
}
```

for one GO application we will have only one main, because we can have only one entry point per application.

5. The next thing we will need to import the packages from which we take our functionalities.
So if we want to use the Print functionality we need to import the fmt package:
```
import "fmt"
```
and then to indicate that object on the Print function as 
```
fmt.Print("")
```

6. In order to know what are the default packages that are within 
the GO installation - visit https://pkg.go.dev/std

7. Println command will print in a new line

======================
## Building our App ##
======================

1. Variables and constants - in commit vars and consts

2. Formatting output - in commit with this name
We can use place holders for the variables like this - fmt.Printf("something %v something\n", varName)
we change the Println to Printf, and within the quotes we use %v and at the end of the quotes we will need a \n for new line and after the quotes we need to indicate the name of the var

There are other ways to format output with variables - chack the docs https://pkg.go.dev/fmt@go1.25.5

3. Data types
What happens if we want to use a variable that is yet unknown?
Like using a variable which its value is a user name that the user needs to prompt?

we can define within our
```
func main() {
    var userName
    // ask user for their name

    userName = "Lior"
    fmt.Println(userName)
}
```
But this will result in an error that it expects a data type for the var.
Data types can be Strings, Integers, Booleans, Maps, Arrays ...
So we need to add
```
var userName string
```

4. We can print out the types of the variables by using the %T placeholder:

```
fmt.Printf("conferenceTickets is %T, remainingTickets is %T, conferenceName is %T\n", conferenceTickets, remainingTickets, conferenceName)
```

5. There are several datatypes for numbers, like float (12.34) and uint(which is only allowing positive numbers)
so we can indicate for the number of tickets the uint data type so it will not go under zero.

6. Another way to declare variabels, instead of the first, use the second:

```
var conferenceName = "Go Conference"
conferenceName := "Go Conference"
```

This works with VARS ONLY and not with constants
